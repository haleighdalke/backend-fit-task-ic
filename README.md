# README

This is the back-end Rails for the Fit-Task-Tic frontend React app. In here, we seeded certain data we 
need to test our app. We created the password and authentication steps we want so we can login to our
app. We used a serializer only for the user so he can see all the necessary data on his personal page.
For more information, check out the frontend fit-task-tic readme.
